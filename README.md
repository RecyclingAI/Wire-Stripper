# Wire-Stripper
Stripper has 4 stages: Slice, Flatten, Curl/roll, Grab &amp; Pull apart. The Flatten stage presses the final 5-10 cm or so with a  press or hammer (depending on gauge) Then when it goes through Currling the Copper which is ductile will stay curled  while the insulation will spring back straight! a Robotic finger can then grab each piece and separate it
